# Introduction. 
## Motivation. 
Financial trading is an active field in both academia and industry. 
Traditional approaches include fundamental analysis, technical analysis, or a combination of the two \cite{secanalysis}. 
Algorithmic approaches were made possible by the microcomputer revolution along with the computerization of the order flow in financial markets in the 1970s. 
Researchers and practitioners use several mathematical and statistical models to identify predictive signals that lead to excess returns. 
The availability and affordability of computing power, storage, and data have lowered the barrier of entry to algorithmic methods.
Developing these methods is non-trivial as financial markets are dynamic and the signal-to-noise ratio of financial data is low \cite{taleb1997dynamic}. 
Recently, researchers and practitioners have turned their attention to Machine Learning (ML) because of its ability to identify signals and capture relationships in large datasets. 
Rather than relying on manual feature engineering, a machine learning model can learn feature representation directly from data. 
ML model's ability to adapt to dynamic environments and continuously optimize its performance makes it a powerful tool for trading financial markets. 




Most research on trading using machine learning has focused on supervised learning approaches. 
These models are regression or classification based and optimized to minimize the forecast error on historical data. 
Price forecasting, however, is only one facet of trading financial markets. 
In addition to neglecting risk, these models ignore exogenous market factors such as transaction costs and lack of liquidity. 
Reinforcement Learning (RL) may align better with the problem of trading financial markets. 
RL integrates the forecasting and portfolio construction into one step and is jointly optimized. 
Investors can tailor the optimization to suit their risk tolerance. 
Learning occurs by interacting with the environment, so RL agents must conform to market limitations, and no labeled training data is required.
